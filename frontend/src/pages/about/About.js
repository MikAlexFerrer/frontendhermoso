              Founded in 2021 in Guadalajara, Endurance.com has grown from a
              small school project to a less small school project.
              Endurance.comâ€™s mission is to get a decent grade to make hours of
              missed sleep feel at least somewhat worthwhile.
            </p>
            <p>
              By investing in coffee that makes us developers work an
              unacceptable amount of hours, Endurance.com barely does just
              enough of what it is supposed to do, which is showing only a
              couple of curated destinations because we all know tourists are
              basic and they only visit the same five locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Endurance.com is available in an astonishing 1 language because
              bilingualism costs extra and we are too poor and cheap to pay for
              a translator. Anyway, enjoy our site, because we are way too sleep
              deprived to do so ourselves.
